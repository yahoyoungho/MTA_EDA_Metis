# MTA_EDA_Metis

WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) wants to hold an annual gala for upcoming summer.
To prepare for the gala, WTWY is going to have a fundraiser where they collect email addresses at the station, but they want to know where to go at what day.
Using MTA subway station turnstile data, my team has analyzed what day and what station will be the best choice to have WTWY's survey team to be placed at.
Our team has used Pandas, and matplotlib in order to achieve this goal.
Using this outcomes, WTWY will be able to know the optimal location and time to maximize the number of email collection.
